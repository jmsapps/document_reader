Spikes in food prices and related insecurities following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, as well as bouts of extreme weather, have accentuated these difficulties. The global average temperature in July 2023 was the highest on record for any month, amid reports of cat- astrophic flooding, heat waves, and wildfires in many regions. Overall, the global prevalence of undernour- ishment is significantly higher than before the pan- demic (FAO and others 2023).</p><h2>Resilient Start to 2023, Signs of Slowdown</h2><p>Despite these persistent challenges, several head- winds to global growth subsided earlier this year. The World Health Organization announced in May that it no longer considered COVID-19 a global health emergency, and infections and hospitalizations appear to remain relatively limited, despite a recent uptick in some regions. Supply chains, which the pandemic disrupted, have largely normalized, with shipping costs and suppliers&#x27; delivery times back to prepandemic lev- els (Figure 1.2). And global financial conditions eased after Swiss and US authorities took strong action in March to contain turbulence in their banking sectors.</p><p>Amid these conditions, global GDP expanded by 3.4 percent in the second quarter of 2023 compared</p><p>2</p><p>International Monetary Fund | October 2023</p></body></html>
